# Details of the spinoff
Spunoff completed on Aug 1 2024. So it has been 6 months since the spinoff complete.

Spinoff where HHH shareholders received 1 share of SEG for every 9 shares of HHH.
At the time of spinoff, that was 5.6 million shares

the Seaport Entertainment division of Howard Hughes (the "Company"), that includes HHH’s entertainment-related real estate assets and operations, which are concentrated in New York and Las Vegas, including the Seaport in Lower Manhattan (the “Seaport”), a 25% ownership stake in Jean-Georges Restaurants as well as other partnerships, the Las Vegas Aviators Triple-A Minor League Baseball team (the “Aviators”) and the Las Vegas Ballpark, and an interest in and to 80% of the air rights above the Fashion Show mall in Las Vegas.

HHH wanted to spinoff SEG because HHH is a managed communities (residential) development, and SEG is more focused on growth and on entertainment opportunities.

# Rights offering
After spinoff, SEG had a rights offering where they sold an additional 7 million shares. The rights offering was oversubscribed, so all 7 million shares were sold.
At 25 per share, that means SEG now has an additional 175 million cash.
There are now 12.6 million shares on the market.


# Simple valuation

From Reddit:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ecvmq4/seaport_entertainment_seg_spinoff/lfti0up/
I run a concentrated deep value book. Here is my sum of the parts in million USD:

200- 250 Water Street (bought for 183 in 2018)
60 - Tin Building (not stabilized)
40 - 85 South Street Apartments (exchanged for 20 in 2024)
200 Pier 17 (tax-assessed at 77 in 2024, ESPN is playing poker but will likely renew their lease, said to be highest lease in Manhattan)
40 - Vegas Aviators (bought for 36, carrying value of 22 per HHH 10K)
200 - Vegas Ballpark (opened in 2019, 150 construction cost)
304 - 80% air rights above Fashion Show Mall, 1.9mn sqft., valued at $200/sqft., Brookfield owning remaining 20% and mall, plans to redevelop into a casino and/or hotel
68 - net cash, not sure this excludes the one time cash infusion HHH CFO mentioned in the transcript so I will ignore those additional 23

= 1,112 mil worth. With 12.6 mil shares, that is a unlocked value of $88/share, if the company doesn't go bankrupt.

## Liabilities
They have a yearly mortgate payment of 14.7 million per year.
Their Capex is over 100 mil / year
At this rate, their 175 mil cash will disappear very quickly.
They will have to raise, and if they raise, they will have to either raise more shares through a rights offering, or they will have to issue debt.
They probably will raise through equity, since Pershing sq is backing them. This means equity holders will get diluted (SAD)
In a ways, this is a good way for Pershing square to keep buying them out and taking more and more control. Essentially they just keep selling their shares to Pershing sq at 25/share and using that cash to pay their Capex.

# Competitive advantages
Unique Focus on the Intersection of Entertainment and Real Estate to Create Inclusive, Consumer-Centric Destinations. Seaport Entertainment will be one of the few publicly traded companies focused on the intersection of entertainment and real estate. Unlike real estate investment trusts, which have limitations on their ability to invest in non-real estate assets, Seaport Entertainment will have flexibility to invest in both real estate as well as entertainment-focused operating assets. We intend to create communities and experience-driven neighborhoods as opposed to standalone assets. As a result, our focus on the social needs of our customers and providing an array of food, entertainment and leisure options to keep them engaged distinguishes our business from traditional real estate development and landlord operations

# Risks

SEG has been losing $25 - $30mm/yr - before spin-off costs, balance-sheet write-downs, and depreciation & amortization.

This doesn't include capx, either for maintenance, or to develop the assets that they haven't built so far. E.g. SEG spent~$108mm in 2023 on capx - mostly for development of 250 water street, plus some $ spent covering operating losses at the Tin Building that they capitalized instead of expensed. 250 Water street is supposed to be an $850mm project. Its not clear how much of that HHH/SEG has invested so far, but I'm guessing maybe $300mm - $350mm-ish. This leaves maybe $500mm in additional $ that SEG will need to raise from somewhere.

One positive aspect is that they have an agreement on the Tin Building JV that upon the JV being profitable (if that ever happens), they will get their investment back and a preferred return, then they will get their share of profits.

 The Company does not currently have, nor does it expect to generate from operations, adequate liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months. 
To mitigate such conditions, HHH contributed capital of $23.4 million to the Company on July 31, 2024, prior to the Separation to support the operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company. 
The Company also expects to receive gross proceeds of $175.0 million in the Rights Offering and have additional access to liquidity up to $5.0 million under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Management believes that cash on hand and the contribution of $23.4 million of cash by HHH pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the capital that will be raised from the Rights Offering, along with amounts available under the Revolving Credit Agreement, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the Company’s projected obligations for at least twelve months. 

Their cash bleed as of their June quarterly report, was 39 million per half year. This doesn't include Capex. So 78 mil per year.
In their September report, it was 48 million per 3/4 year. So 64 per year?
Capex was 33 mil per half year, 66 mil per year.
In their Sep report, it was 82 mil per 3/4 year. Most of that was for property development. So 109 mil / year
Mortgate payments is 1 mil per half year, 2 mil per year.

So they only have enough cash left to last 16 months!
But it also seems like they are getting cash from the parent company? Not as a loan but as a direct cash injection.


thomas:
Why are they dealing with 250 water street, a low income housing area, if they want to tie it in with the Tin building, a luxury foods place? they are in the high end entertainment industry it seems, or at least "faux high-end 100+ stuff". So why deal with Section 8 folks? I don't understand their business plan here.

## Tin building
They own 100% of the Tin building, and lease it out to their JV with Jean-Gorges.
That JV they have a 65% share in and bleeds ~8/3 mil per month, or about 32 mil per year (for their share)
Tin building started operations Q3 2022 and has good reviews online.


# Debt
They have a 5 mil revolver with 10% interest from their parent company, so far unused (Jun report)

10k shares of 14% preferred stock
