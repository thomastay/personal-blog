Dear recruiter, if you've got a link to this blog post, your email is not interesting. Here's why. Let's take a look at three emails I've gotten in the last 8 weeks:

---

From: ${Nice Recruiter} ${recruiter}@${Company}.com

To: Thomas ${My Email}@gmail

### Email Specimen 1

## My Reply

Let's start with the most obvious issue. I don't like phone calls. Last week, I had to call Best Buy to get an update on a Christmas gift order, and I absolutely dreaded the process. Call it social anxiety, or perhaps being primed for bad experiences, but just the thought of making a phone call makes me sweat inside.

If I hate phone calls so much, even with a customer service agent whose *job* it is to attend to me, there's no way that I'll enjoy calling you. And I'm willing to bet that many engineers are in the same boat.

So, if you really want to hire me, why not consider email? You're already emailing me, why do we have to switch to a different medium?

### It's not about me

The second issue I have with these emails is that they're totally unrelated to me. Emails 1 and 2 are so clearly a copy-paste message, containing absolutely no personal information at all. Email number 3 at least got my present company and previous company right (shout out to them!), but apart from that none of the remaining 200 words had anything to do with me.

If your email has nothing to do with me, then it's basically a job ad. If I want to read those, I can do so from the comfort of a job board like Indeed or LinkedIn. I don't appreciate my email inbox being cluttered with job ads. 

Can you imagine if we applied to jobs this way? Just imagine the email you'd see in your inbox:

> Dear Recruiter,
>
> I'm ${blah blah}, a high performing software engineer skilled in Typescript, GraphQL, Web Workers and large-scale Web Application development. At work every day, I face many technical challenges and deal with many high-profile clients.
>
> After seeing your company's email online, I had to reach out. I envision myself playing a key role in your Web Application infrastructure, whatever that may be.
>
> Please hire me for a job and let me know if you're interested in a quick interview.

Ridiculous, isn't it? Anyone who applied to a job this way would get their email laughed at before being dumped straight to spam. Here's 3 problems with my fictitious application:

1. I didn't specify what job I was applying for.
1. I didn't show any knowledge about your company.
1. I didn't explain why my skills would be relevant to your company.

For these 3 reasons, the fictitious job application is not interesting and not actionable. The same three reasons apply to your email too.

If you really are interested in hiring me, then I'd appreciate some elbow grease being put in. 

### It's not about the job

> You can't manage what you can't measure - Peter Drucker, quoted out of context

None of the 3 emails above mentioned a specific role that they wanted me for. But even in the emails that did (not shown here), many of them don't give much information about the role. Often, it's some vague engineering position that does something.

I mean, just look at email number 3's job description. 

> We're looking to hire a product engineer to help guide the definition and development of our product roadmap. You'll partner closely with the product team to understand user needs, provide a finer technical understanding of the development plan, and write production-ready code to implement. You'll also be focused on developing an execution plan for higher level feature requests.

What does the product engineer do? What does "product" mean? The description is so vague you could apply it to every software engineer (SWE) posting out there. It's so devoid of context that I left it in completely uncensored because there's no way anyone could trace it back to your company. That's bad.

One company even asked me to apply for a Senior Software Engineer position. While I'm flattered, I don't think a fresh grad one year out of college would be a great senior SWE, and if you think so, I **definitely** don't want to work there.

I take jobs because I need someone to pay for my sushi addiction. If your job can't pay me well, why should I apply?

Suppose your job does pay well, though. How would I know, if you never mention it?

Here's some details that might make the pain of filling out your job application form worth it:

- Location
- Salary information
- Remote or not?
- Role and what I'll be working on
- How much creative freedom I have

Notice that you can usually get this information on a job board like Indeed, because *thats exactly what candidates look for*.

### It's not about you

I want to end this rant by remembering the human. Look, ${Nice recruiter}, I'm sure you're a nice person. I'm sure that if we were to meet in person, I'd be happy to drink a beer, eat a meal, or just chat about random stuff with you.

This isn't about you, and my criticism isn't personal. If anything, I hope that this encourages you to change the email template you have. Because your email currently isn't very nice.

Look, I even called you Nice Recruiter! And I mean it with no hint of sarcasm. Every recruiter has been nice, polite, and respectful, which is why I feel like I should reply. But I just can't, because your email is so soulless and so devoid of anything to reply to.

# So what now?

I'm going to offer a challenge. If you send me with an email addressing all of these concerns, I will get on a phone call with you if I like the offer. If I don't, I will write you a personalized email explaining why not.

If you need info about me, [my home page serves as my resume](/).

I'm willing to step up and dial some numbers into my keypad if it means improving the quality of job recruiting emails for all of us. I'll also put your initials and company into the appendix of good emails.

And if you can't, but you found this email interesting, please send me an email with the title: [Loved your blog post] to thomastayac@gmail.com

## Appendix - good emails I've gotten

Shout out to L.C. of Hudson River Trading. Your email was clear, succinct, and even came with a PDF explaining the job role. I appreciate this and while I was not keen on the company, I liked your email.

# FAQ

1. Is this a real email response?

Probably not.

2. Isn't it nice to be wanted?

Yes, I'm flattered every time I get a recruiter email, but it doesn't mean I can't be picky. 

3. I don't have time to personalize every email!

I don't have time to respond to every one either.

4. You misunderstand, these emails aren't meant to encourage you to apply, they're there to spread awareness of the company.

Then I hope you won't mind if I mark you as spam, encouraging Gmail's spam filter to block future recruitment emails from your company. Your loss.
